Angular Notes
-------------------------------------

TYPESCRIPT = MODERN JS + STRONG TYPE

Modern JS -> EcmaScript 2015 - ES6
- class,import classes from other modules, rest and spread operators, string template, decorators, 
	arrow operator, default parameters, Map, Set, Symbol type


Commands:-
--------------------------------------

ng build -> dist -> subfolder is used to deploy the application to production environment
ng test -> runs unit test
ng e2e -> runs end to end tests by building and running entire application
ng lint -> static code analyzer

Unit tests are written using Jasmine framework and runned using Karma.
E2E tests are written using Protractor framework which uses Selenium in the background and runned by chromedriver.

Files in Angular application:-
-----------------------------------------

Lint -> code standards configuration file
tslint.json -> coding standard rules are specified here
angular.json -> contains definitions of angular commands

app -> angular code like modules,components
assets - static resources like images
enviroments - all configurations for different enviroments like dev,production, testing, QA

tsconfig.json -> typescript to javascript conversion specification
README.md -> project documentation

package.json -> external frameworks and packages needed to run angular commands and tools to run angular application
		and tests are specified here
	     -> npm install will download all the above to node_modules folder
	     -> ng new appName -> will internally run npm install so all the dependencies are downloaded into node_modules

When Angular applications starts index.html and main.ts files are loaded which bootstrap the process( root module is loaded)
- RootModule is launched by main.ts and will be included in index.html and that's how it is bootstrapped

polyfills.ts -> takes care of browser incompatibility
styles.css -> global styles for application
test.ts -> starting point to run unit tests
